                    <h4>HTML</h4>
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, used to structure and display content on web pages. It employs a system of tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more, providing the basic structure and organization for web content.</p>

                    <h4>CSS</h4>
                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. By separating content from design, CSS allows developers to create responsive, aesthetically pleasing websites that work across various devices and screen sizes. With CSS, you can apply styles to multiple elements simultaneously, enabling efficient and consistent design management.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables developers to create rich user interfaces, control multimedia, animate images, and handle complex web applications. JavaScript is essential for front-end development, working seamlessly with HTML and CSS to enhance user experience. Its capabilities extend to server-side development with environments like Node.js, making it a powerful tool for full-stack development.</p>
